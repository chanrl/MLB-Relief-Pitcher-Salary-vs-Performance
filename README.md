Capstone 1

This capstone will be focused on using Selenium to pull relief pitcher salary and stats from Baseball-Reference in order to determine if relief pitchers that are paid more perform better on average.

This year, it appears from a spectator's point of view that all the relief pitchers who were paid a handsome salary are performing terribly and lose leads often. 

This project will attempt to quantify and visualize trends if they do exist with salary against stats such as WAR, blown saves, and IS%.

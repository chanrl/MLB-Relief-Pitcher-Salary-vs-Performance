MLB Relief pitcher salary vs performance

This capstone project will be focused on using Selenium to pull MLB relief pitcher salary and stats from Baseball-Reference in order to determine if there is a positive trend with pitcher salaries and their performance.

In the MLB season of 2019, it appears from a spectator's point of view that all the relief pitchers who have signed a large contract are performing terribly and lose leads often. 

If a GM decides to sign a relief pitcher to a large contract, you would assume that the relief pitcher would be elite or better than an average pitcher. Thus, a relief pitcher with a higher salary should have better stats all around versus one with a lower salary.

This project will visualize and attempt to identify trends in relief pitcher performances and their salary.

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in performance for relief pitchers who are paid more than those that are paid less.

Alternative Hypothesis: Relief pitchers that are signed to a large contract perform differently than those with smaller contracts.
